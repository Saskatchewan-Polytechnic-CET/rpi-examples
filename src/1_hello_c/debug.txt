Debug on the command line with GDB.

gdb ./main_nodebug

Use a breakpoint via:

1. b main

Without the -g, the debugger doesn't have all the symbols to make it easy to read.
You also can't break on line numbers.

Now try with debug symbols.

gdb ./main_debug

Use a breakpoint via:

1. b main
2. b 8 

Notice how the result is easier to read and you can break on line numbers. 

Useful gdb commands:

    b {function name / line number}: Break point
    c: Continue
    n: Next
    p {variable}: Print the value of a variable
